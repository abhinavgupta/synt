The 'synt collect' command allows you to build or fetch a pre-existing
samples database. Samples are used in training the classifier and
consist of a text and label:

    (u'My puppy is so cute! :D', 'positive')

By default collecting uses the Twitter streaming API (via Kral) to pull in
tweets with they keywords: :) (for positive) and :( (for negative).

These do not always yield the best results and serve as a default for the
positive and negative labels.

We've included two text files negwords.txt and poswords.txt that contain positive
words and negative words, these themselves have been curated by iterating over
the most informative features.

Collecting using a "query file" is simple. Pass the query file path
to the collect command:

    synt collect --query_file /home/tawlk/synt/docs/negwords.txt

Currently you must run collect for each query file, that is, you cannot use
multiple query files in one go.

If you'd like to create you own query file with your own words and build a
samples database you can as well. Construct your query file (text) like so:

    label
    query1
    query2
    query3
    etc...

The first line will be treated as the label and subsequent lines as queries.

Experimenting with different queries may be beneficial as that is the basis
for the rest of synt.
